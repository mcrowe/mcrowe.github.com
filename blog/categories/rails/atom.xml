    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was searching for just the right roles system to go with my <code>cancan</code> authorized, <code>ActiveRecord</code>-backed Rails app, and didn't find anything I liked. There are at least a dozen gems out there, but they were all either too simple, too complex, or too ugly for my liking. So, like any good open-sourcer, I wrote my own after my biased taste. And, <code>roleable</code> was born. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mcrowe/roleable">project page</a>, and the <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/roleable/frames">API documentation</a>.</p>

<p><code>roleable</code> is deliberately simple in it's implementation. It allows you to add user roles scoped to a instance of another model (e.g. make a use an author of a given article), or global roles (e.g. an admin role).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Knee-deep in <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code> code yesterday, I was reminded of some interesting nuggets that I've seen used far too rarely. Here, Iâ€™ve gathered my top ten most underused relation methods from that list for your reading delight.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>10. <code>first_or_create</code> with a block</h3>

<p><code>first_or_create</code> is very familiar:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Book.where(:title =&gt; 'Tale of Two Cities').first_or_create
</code></p>

<p>and does exactly what it says. Often, though, you want to find a record with certain attributes, or create one with those <em>and</em> additional attributes. To do this succinctly, you can supply a block to <code>first_or_create</code>:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Book.where(:title =&gt; 'Tale of Two Cities').first_or_create do |book|
  book.author = 'Charles Dickens'
  book.published_year = 1859
end
</code></p>

<h3>9. <code>first_or_initialize</code></h3>

<p>If you don't want to save the record yet, you can use <code>first_or_initialize</code>:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Book.where(:title =&gt; 'Tale of Two Cities').first_or_initialize
</code></p>

<h3>8. <code>scoped</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes you want an <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code> representing all the records of a class. You can easily generate one using the <code>scoped</code> method:</p>

<p>```ruby
def search(query)
  if query.blank?</p>

<pre><code>scoped
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>q = "%#{query}%"
where("title like ? or author like ?", q, q)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h3>7. <code>none</code> <em>(rails 4 only)</em></h3>

<p>Likewise, sometimes you want an <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code> that contains no objects. Returning an empty array is usually not a great idea if the consumer of your API is expecting a relation object. Instead, you can use <code>none</code>.</p>

<p>```ruby
def filter(filter_name)
  case filter_name
  when :all</p>

<pre><code>scoped
</code></pre>

<p>  when :published</p>

<pre><code>where(:published =&gt; true)
</code></pre>

<p>  when :unpublished</p>

<pre><code>where(:published =&gt; false)
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>none
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  You have to be seriously living on the edge to use <code>none</code> right now. It will be available in rails 4, but not 3. It is easy to write your own in the meantime, though, checkout this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4877931/how-to-return-an-empty-activerecord-relation">stack overflow thread</a>.</p>

<h3>6. <code>find_each</code></h3>

<p>If you want to iterate over thousands of records, you probably don't want to use <code>each</code>. It will execute a single query to get all the records, and then instantiate them all into memory. If you have enough memory to spare, go for it. Otherwise, this is a nice way to freeze up your Rails app! <code>find_each</code> instead finds a batch of records at a time (1000 by default) and yields those one at a time, so that you don't have them all in memory at the same time.</p>

<p>```ruby
Book.where(:published => true).find_each do |book|</p>

<pre><code>puts "Do something with #{book.title} here!"
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>Note that you can't specify the order of records yielded by <code>find_each</code>. If you specify one on your relation, it will simply be ignored.</p>

<h3>5. <code>to_sql</code> and <code>explain</code></h3>

<p><code>ActiveRecord</code> is great, but it doesn't always generate the queries you think it will. Jump in the console and run these commands on the relation you're building, to make sure it maps to a smart query, or that it's using the indices you lovingly crafted:</p>

<p>```ruby
Library.joins(:book).to_sql</p>

<h1>=> SQL query for you database.</h1>

<p>Libray.joins(:book).explain</p>

<h1>=> Database explain for the query.</h1>

<p>```</p>

<h3>4. <code>find_by</code> <em>(rails 4 only)</em></h3>

<p>Rails code tends to be littered with lines like:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Book.where(:title =&gt; 'Three Day Road', :author =&gt; 'Joseph Boyden').first
</code></p>

<p>Instead, you can use the shortcut method <code>find_by</code>:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Book.find_by(:title =&gt; 'Three Day Road', :author =&gt; 'Joseph Boyden')
</code></p>

<p>which does exactly the same thing.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  You have to be seriously living on the edge to use <code>find_by</code> right now. It will be available in rails 4, but not 3.</p>

<h3>3. <code>scoping</code></h3>

<p>You can "scope" methods on a class to a particular relation. Consider the following example from the Rails documentation:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Comment.where(:post_id =&gt; 1).scoping do
  Comment.first # SELECT * FROM comments WHERE post_id = 1
end
</code></p>

<p>This is all kinds of useful.</p>

<h3>2. <code>pluck</code></h3>

<p>Want an array of column values for certain records? I've seen this too many times:</p>

<p><code>ruby
published_book_titles = Book.published.select(:title).map(&amp;:title)
</code></p>

<p>Or, even worse:</p>

<p><code>ruby
published_book_titles = Book.published.map(&amp;:title)
</code></p>

<p>Instead, use pluck:</p>

<p><code>ruby
published_book_titles = Book.published.pluck(:title)
</code></p>

<h3>1. <code>merge</code></h3>

<p>I couldn't live without this jewel, but it's strangely un-documented in the source, and not mentioned in any guide or book I've seen. Among other uses, it allows you to do a join, and filter by a named scope on the joined model:</p>

<p>```ruby
class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...</p>

<p>  # Returns all the accounts that have unread messages.
  def self.with_unread_messages</p>

<pre><code>joins(:messages).merge( Message.unread )
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Internet Explorer is still more than 60% of my traffic, and I need to do a lot of feature testing on it. A lot of folks push up to a staging server then point a virtual machine to that server. This is too slow for me. Especially when I'm hunting down and fixing particularly pernicious css bugs, there is a lot of tweaking involved, and re-deploying for each test just doesn't cut it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Instead, I setup VirtualBox to connect to my development server so I don't need to re-deploy to see changes in IE. It makes debugging in IE almost as easy as in other browsers!</p>

<p>Assuming you have, or can, setup VirtualBox with XP or Windows 7 (if not there are a thousand tutorials on google), the rest takes a couple of seconds. VirtualBox's default setting will allow it to connect to your Mac's localhost through <code>http://10.0.2.2</code>. Forwarding ports is messier, so instead we can run rails on port 80. This requires running your server as a super user. Assuming you're using rvm, run:</p>

<pre><code>rvmsudo rails server -p 80
</code></pre>

<p>and verify you can hit the server at <code>http://localhost</code> on your Mac, and <code>http://10.0.2.2</code> in VirtualBox. You're good to go!</p>

<p>While you're at it, I'd recommend installing <a href="http://utilu.com/IECollection/">IE Collection</a>, so that you can easily test on all versions of IE on the same box.</p>
